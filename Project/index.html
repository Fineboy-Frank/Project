                <p>I grew up in the southern part of Nigeria. I was born and raised in Rivers state, so all I know about my country is what I've seen within my state. <br>
                I am currently in my final year in the University of Port Harcourt, majoring in Biochemistry although I hope to pursue a career in tech and hopefully and web development to my skill array.
